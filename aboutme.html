      <td style="vertical-align: top;">I am&nbsp;currently working in&nbsp;  <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/index.php" target="_blank">Los Alamos National Laboratories</a>
as a staff scientist after one year of postdoc. Before this, I
completed my PhD in Data analysis and visualization from The Ohio State
University in 2016.<br>I am originally from India and I was born in Kolkata (<a target="_blank" href="Kolkata_Imgs.jpg">image</a>),
a vintage city that used to be the capital of India until 1911. At the
age of 5, our family moved to a beautiful small town called
Chandannagar(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandannagar" target="_blank">wiki</a>).
Being a French colony before India's independence, this place was very
different from Kolkata. I went to Kanailal Vidyamandir (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanailal_Vidyamandir">wiki</a>)
for schooling and spent the most fun-filled 12 years of my life. I
completed my undergraduate study in Computer Science and Engineering
from <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/" target="_blank">Jadavpur University, Kolkata.</a> After securing a job with <a href="http://www.st.com/web/en/home.html" target="_blank">STMicroelectronics</a> , I then went to Greater Noida and worked for 3 years with some great minds. Then completed my PhD from <a href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/" target="_blank">OSU</a> (Columbus,Ohio), exploring a whole new world. For past four summers (2012-2015), I went to  <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/index.php" target="_blank">Los Alamos National Laboratories</a>,
(Los Alamos, New Mexico) for internship where I am currently working. Situated at 7200 ft from the
sea level, Los Alamos is a very beautiful small city away from the
hustles and bustles of other big cities. Me and my&nbsp;wife love this place a lot.<br>
      <br>
I love sports, all kinds of them. I mostly play football(soccer), cricket, badminton, table-tennis, tennis and what not.<br>
In club football, I am supporting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chelseafc.com">Chelsea</a> since 1998. &nbsp;They won the EPL this year (2016-2017 season) emphatically. <br>
Here is a quick link to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chelseafc.com/matches/fixtures---results.html">fixtures and upcoming
games</a>.<br>
      In the international arena, I am supporting Brazil since the 94 world cup.<br>
