<A>I have decided to work on the project of continuous scatter plots as described by Sven Bachthaler and Daniel Weiskopf. In this paper, they have described the ways of generating continuous scatter plots from a set of data where the spatial domain and the data domain can be of any dimensions. They have illustrated how to figure out the mapping functions for different scenarios of the dimensionalities.</A>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<H2>Goals:</H2>
<br>
<br>
<A>1) Reading the paper over and over again to get all the intricacies and subtleties in the algorithm. 
Read the associated papers as cited by the authors to get to know about the background and 
related works in greater depth. Collect the input data.</A>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<A>2) Start the implementation phase of the project. Identify what language and tools to be used and 
start with the algorithm development.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<A>3) Come up with the first set of outcome from the code.( Atleast for m=n case). Analyse the results and finding the missing components.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<A>4) Submit the project with final results (some work on m &lt; n case if possible).</A>
