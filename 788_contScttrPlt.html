<h1><span style="font-weight: bold;">Project 788</span></h1>


<br>


This is a project where I am working at generating "Continuous Scatter
Plot" for continuous input data rather than showing the discrete
scatter plot. The data is given in 3-Dimensional spatial domain (x,y
and z coordinates) and 1-Dimensional scalar data. I take the gradient
of the scalar data to make the scalar data 2-dimensional and then work
on the algorithm to output the continuous scatter plot. I am working on
the case from the paper &nbsp;(m &lt; n) which is mostly found in the
regular datasets.<br>


<br>


Here is my <a href="project_proposal.html">project proposal</a><br>


<br>


<a href="http://www.vis.uni-stuttgart.de/%7Ebachthsn/publications/VIS08/VIS08_Final.pdf">Paper Reference : Continuous Scatter Plot</a><br>


<br>


<h3>Progress in the Project</h3>


1. Collected the input dataset. This data set is 3-D(spatial) X 1-D(scalar).<br>
<br>
2. Read the input dataset into an array. I used my own code for this. I
did not use NrrdIO library because I had troubles compiling that for
windows.<br>
<br>


3. Calculate the gradient of the input scalar data and store in the
array. Now we have 3-D(spatial) X 2-D(scalar) data set as the input.<br>
<br>


4. The input mesh is broken into cubes.<br>
<br>


5. Each cube is decomposed into six tetrahedrons. (No cracking problem)<br>
<br>


6. Now each tetrahedron is projected into data space and is further divided into triangles.<br>
<br>
7. Each triangle has 3 points each of which has two scalar values. I
calculate the IsoSurfaces for the traingle vertices' scalar values.
Inside the tetrahedron, the Isosurface is a triangle.
This&nbsp;algorithm which finds the Isosurface inside the tetrahedron
is written by me. I did not use any of the&nbsp;existing &nbsp;marching
tetrahedron library already available inside OSU.<br>
<br>


8. For each vertex, we have two triangles for the two scalar values.
Now I calculate the intersection of the two triangles. This is a
straight line. The length of the line is calculated and stored.<br>
<br>


9. Volume measure is calculated as the cross product of the gradient of the two scalar values.<br>
<br>


10. Divide the line length by volume measure and use this value to look
up from a predefined color map and assign the color to the vertex.<br>
<br>


11. Using OpenGL, I repeat these steps for all the triangles and their vertices and draw on screen with additive blending.<br>


<br>


<h3>Results</h3>


I have tested my code on a few datasets. I have computed the
discrete scatter plot first. Then I got the continuous scatter
&nbsp;plot. I am attaching the results for shockwave.raw and teddybear.raw&nbsp;below.<br>
<br>
The scalar data is in the X-axis and the gradient of the scalar data is in the Y-axis for the output scatter plots.<br>

<h3>Remaining works</h3>

Extend the code for functions which are partially constant (The case where the volume measure is 0).<br>
